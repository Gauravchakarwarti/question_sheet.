    Create a program that converts a given string to uppercase.

3.  How do you convert a string to an integer in JavaScript?
    Implement a function in Java that checks if a given year is a leap year.

4.  What is type casting? Provide an example.
     Write a C++ program to concatenate two strings without using the built-in concatenation function.

5.  What is the significance of "null" in programming languages?
     Develop a program in Python that calculates the area of a rectangle.

Operators:

1.    Create a program that determines if a given year is a leap year using the modulo operator.

2.   What is operator precedence, and why is it important?
     Implement a Python program to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.

3.  How do you use the bitwise AND operator to check if a number is even or odd?
    Create a C program to determine if a given character is a vowel or a consonant.

4.   What is short-circuiting in logical operators?
     Write a JavaScript function to find the largest element in an array.

5.   Explain the difference between postfix and prefix increment operators.
     Develop a C++ program that generates the Fibonacci sequence using a loop.

Conditional Statements:

1.   Describe the usage of the "switch" statement in C.
     Write a Python program that determines whether a given number is prime.

2.   How would you handle multiple conditions using "if-else if" statements?
     Implement a Java program to calculate the sum of digits in a given number.

3.   What is a nested ternary operator?
     Create a C program that checks if a given year is a leap year using nested "if-else" statements.

4.   Explain the concept of "short-circuit evaluation" in conditional statements.
     Write a Python program to find the factorial of a number using a recursive function.

5.   How do you avoid the "dangling else" problem in nested if-else statements?
     Develop a Java program that determines if a given string is a palindrome.

Looping Statements:
    
1.    Write a program that checks if a given number is a perfect square using a "for" loop.

2.    Interview Question: How does the "break" statement work in loops? Provide an example.
      Write a Python program to print the multiplication table of a given number using a "while" loop.

3.   Explain the difference between a "while" loop and a "do-while" loop.
     Create a Java program that calculates the sum of all even numbers up to a given limit using a loop.

4.    Describe the use of the "continue" statement in loops.
      Develop a C program to print the first "n" prime numbers.

5.   How would you create an infinite loop intentionally? How would you break out of it?
     Write a JavaScript program to check if a given number is a perfect square using a loop.

Functions:
    
1.    What is the significance of function parameters and arguments?

2.    Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the sum of all even numbers.
3.
4.    Implement a recursive function to calculate the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence.

5.    How does scope affect variable accessibility within functions?
    Describe the process of "calling" a function and "returning" from a function.
